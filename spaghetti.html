    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Cream Layers:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
      <li>½ cup confectioners' sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chocolate milk powder</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons instant espresso powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Cookie Layers:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup brewed coffee</li>
      <li>1 individual package graham crackers</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li> Beat heavy whipping cream with an electric mixer in a chilled bowl until soft peaks form. Beat
        confectioners'
        sugar, chocolate milk powder, and espresso powder into the whipped cream until the color is consistent and you
        again have soft peaks.
      </li>
      <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly,
        5
        to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Season beef with Greek seasoning, salt, and pepper.</li>
      <li>Pour coffee into a wide, shallow bowl. Dip graham crackers briefly in the coffee and layer into the bottom
        of
        a loaf
        pan in a single layer to cover the bottom. Spread about 1/4 of the whipping cream mixture over the crackers.
        Repeat
        layering with remaining ingredients to get four layers each of the cream and the cookies.</li>
      <li>Cover loaf pan with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, at least 2 hours.
      </li>
    </ol>
