      This is a recipe I came up with when I was helping to raise 6 kids. Every penny counted. You can add onions if
      desired.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (12 ounce) package egg noodles</li>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Greek seasoning (such as Cavender'sÂ®)</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
      <li>1 pint sour cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring
        occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes; drain.</li>
      <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5
        to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Season beef with Greek seasoning, salt, and pepper.</li>
      <li>Heat vegetable oil in a separate skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir mushrooms in hot oil until tender,
        about 5 minutes; add to ground beef.</li>
      <li>Stir sour cream into ground beef mixture; cook and stir until hot, about 5 minutes. Serve over egg noodles.
      </li>
