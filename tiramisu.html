        I was craving coffee and chocolate one night and came up with this yummy version using graham crackers. Drizzle
        chocolate syrup over individual slices, if you like, for extra chocolate flavor.
      </p>

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <h4>Cream Layers:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>½ cup confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chocolate milk powder</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons instant espresso powder</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Cookie Layers:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>½ cup brewed coffee</li>
        <li>1 individual package graham crackers</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li> Beat heavy whipping cream with an electric mixer in a chilled bowl until soft peaks form. Beat
          confectioners'
          sugar, chocolate milk powder, and espresso powder into the whipped cream until the color is consistent and you
          again have soft peaks.
        </li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly,
          5
          to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Season beef with Greek seasoning, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Pour coffee into a wide, shallow bowl. Dip graham crackers briefly in the coffee and layer into the bottom
          of
          a loaf
          pan in a single layer to cover the bottom. Spread about 1/4 of the whipping cream mixture over the crackers.
          Repeat
          layering with remaining ingredients to get four layers each of the cream and the cookies.</li>
        <li>Cover loaf pan with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, at least 2 hours.
        </li>
      </ol>
